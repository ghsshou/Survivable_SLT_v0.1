This file denotes the parameters can set to run simulation

in test_main.java:
'pro_type' can set the protection type want to simulate, including "Sharing", "Full", and "None".

Traffic number: In file 'TrafficManager.java':_traffic_NUM;
The traffic numbers that are not used to calculate resource utilization: In file 'MainProcedure.java':no_record_num;

PS:
1.the procedure for a single MR takes about 220~300ms, so the due time of a MR should be larger than that.
2.in the function "get_current_resource_utilization", if you want to cheat, you can annotate certain code.
3.in topology 'US_backbone_28', datacenters are 6,17,22
4.in topology 'cost239', datacenters are 0,3,8

Development Log: For segment protection.
Note:
1.The steps are: first, grouping; second, primary tree calculating and segments dividing; third, backup segment calculating;
fourth, allocate resource.
2.Don't consider adaptive spectrum allocation.
3.When calculating backup segments, don't consider the sharing between different distributed trees of a MR. That is, when update graph,
the cost of links don't be affected by other backup segments of another distributed tree of the same MR.
4.In Distance-Adaptive Spectrum Allocation, we decide the modulation according to the longest distance of the branch, without considering
the user number. So, in topology 'cost239', the BP of the case of 'distributed light-tree' is higher than that of the case with 'single light-tree'
