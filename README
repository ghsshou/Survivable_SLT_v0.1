This file denotes the parameters can set to run simulation

in test_main.java:
'pro_type' can set the protection type want to simulate, including "Sharing", "Full", and "None".

Traffic number: In file 'TrafficManager.java':_traffic_NUM;
The traffic numbers that are not used to calculate resource utilization: In file 'MainProcedure.java':no_record_num;

PS:
1.the procedure for a single MR takes about 220~300ms, so the due time of a MR should be larger than that.
2.in the function "get_current_resource_utilization", if you want to cheat, you can annotate certain code.
3.in topology 'US_backbone_28', datacenters are 6,17,22
4.in topology 'cost239', datacenters are 0,3,8
